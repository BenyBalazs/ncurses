# D Ncurses Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started.

The main site where these examples were originally found is here [tldp.org](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/)
These examples need some work, but they should demonstrate that most everything is in working order.

To run the examples, change to the specific directory and build and execute the example with "dub run".

### Requirements:
    - [rdmd](http://github.com/D-Programming-Language/tools)
    - ncursesw

### Examples
    - helloWorld   - a simple hello world example.
    - helloUnicode - a simple unicode example.
    - keyCode      - returns the number code of the key you pressed.
    - simpleColor  - a simple example that demonstrates color output.

### TODO
[ ] review, and fix anything that's broken.
[ ] cosmetic alterations.
[ ] add to travis.
[ ] fix so that examples are compilable on Windows.

Again, please file any bugs that you come across.
Even if you don't know if it is actually a bug, we appreciate the time.
We understand that sometimes it is hard to figure out.
